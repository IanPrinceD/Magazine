<!--Step 1 Passed

Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element specifying this page is in English, a head element, and a body element.

Add a <meta> tag with the appropriate charset and a <meta> tag for mobile responsiveness within the head element.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8" />
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<!--Step 2 Passed

Add a title element with the text Magazine, a link element for the https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton%7CBaskervville%7CRaleway&display=swap font stylesheet, a link for the https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css FontAwesome stylesheet, and a link for your ./styles.css stylesheet.

Your font stylesheet will load three separate fonts: Anton, Baskervville, and Raleway.
--> 
 <title>Magazine</title>
 <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton%7CBaskervville%7CRaleway&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css" />
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>

<body>
 <!--Step 3 Passed

Within your body, create a main element. Then in that element, create a section with a class set to heading.
-->
 <main>
  <section class="heading">
<!--Step 4 Passed

Within your .heading element, create a header element with the class set to hero.

In that element, create an img element with the src set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png, the alt set to freecodecamp logo, and the class set to hero-img.

The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed (as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.

Give your new img element a loading attribute set to lazy.
-->   
   <header class="hero">
<!--Step 6 Passed

Your image currently takes up a lot of space. To better see what you are working on, add a width attribute to the img element, with a value of 400.

You will remove this later on when you have worked on the CSS.
-->

<!--Step 43 Passed

You should remove the temporary width attribute before writing the CSS for your .hero-img.
-->
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png" alt="freecodecamp logo"
     loading="lazy" class="hero-img" />
<!--Step 5 Passed

After your img element, add an h1 element with the class set to hero-title and the text set to OUR NEW CURRICULUM, followed by a p element with the class set to hero-subtitle and the text set to Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus.
-->     
    <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtitle">
     Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based
     focus
    </p>
   </header>
<!--Step 7 Passed

After your header element, create a div with the class set to author.

Within that div, create a p element with the class set to author-name and give it the text By freeCodeCamp. Wrap the freeCodeCamp portion in an a element with the href set to https://freecodecamp.org, and the target set to _blank.

Below that, add a second p element with the class publish-date and the text March 7, 2019.
-->   
   <div class="author">
    <p class="author-name">
     By
<!--Step 8 Passed

The Referer HTTP header contains information about the address or URL of a page that a user might be visiting from. This information can be used in analytics to track how many users from your page visit freecodecamp.org, for example. Setting the rel attribute to noreferrer omits this information from the HTTP request. Give your a element a rel attribute set to noreferrer.
-->     
     <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a>
    </p>
    <p class="publish-date">March 7, 2019</p>
   </div>
<!--Step 9 Passed

Below your .author element, create a new div element with the class social-icons.

Add five a elements within that new div, and give them the following href attributes.

    The first a element should have an href set to https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp.
    The second a element should have an href set to https://twitter.com/freecodecamp.
    The third a element should have an href set to https://instagram.com/freecodecamp.
    The fourth a element should have an href set to https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp.
    The fifth a element should have an href set to https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp.

-->

<!--Step 10 Passed

Within each of your new a elements, add an i element and give them the following classes:

    Your first i element should have the class fab fa-facebook-f
    Your second i element should have the class fab fa-twitter
    Your third i element should have the class fab fa-instagram
    Your fourth i element should have the class fab fa-linkedin-in
    Your fifth i element should have the class fab fa-youtube
-->   
   <div class="social-icons">
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp/">
     <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/freecodecamp/">

     <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>
    </a>
   </div>
  </section>
<!--Step 11 Passed

Below your .heading element, create a new section element with the class set to text. Within that, create a p element with the class set to first-paragraph and the following text:

Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.

    when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel
    possible: the flux capacitor!
   </p>
<!--Step 13 Passed

Add a third p element at the end of your .text element, and give it the following text:

It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)

   </p>
<!--Step 14 Passed

After the three p elements within your .text element, create a blockquote element. Within that, add an hr element, a p element with the class set to quote, and a second hr element.

Give the .quote element the text The entire curriculum should be a series of projects.
-->   
   <blockquote>
    <hr />
    <p class="quote">
     The entire curriculum should be a series of projects
    </p>
    <hr />
   </blockquote>
<!--Step 15 Passed

Below your blockquote element, add another p element with the following text:

No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.

Create a fifth p element at the end of your .text element, and give it the following text:

The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".

Within your ul element, create six li elements. Add an h4 element with a class set to list-subtitle and a p element to each of your li elements.

Then give the h4 and p elements the following text content, in order, with each h4 using what's on the left side of the colon, and each p using what's on the right:

    V1 - 2014: We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
    V2 - 2015: We added interactive algorithm challenges.
    V3 - 2015: We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).
    V4 - 2016: We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.
    V5 - 2017: We added the back end and data visualization challenges.
    V6 - 2018: We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
